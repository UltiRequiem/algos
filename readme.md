## Data Structures

An organized way of storing data for use by computer processes.

```typescript
const user = ["Eliaz", 8777, "Peru", "Frontend", ["English", "Spanish"]];

const user = {
  firstName: "Eliaz",
  contributions: 8777,
  country: "Peru",
  role: "Frontend",
  languagesSpoken: ["English", "Spanish"],
};
```

- Array: Linear collections of elements that are accessed via indices which are usually integers used to compute offsets

- Objects: Store a collection of related data or functionality in the form of key-value pairs

Should the previous snippet be an array or an object?

Array: Little insight into the relationship between the various chunks of data

Object: Shows the relationship with the use of hierarchy and key-value pairs

> The best data structures consume minimal resources while storing data in a meaningful way for various operations
